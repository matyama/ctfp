# Category Theory for Programmers
This repository contains selected examples and solutions to challenges
from [*Category Theory for Programmer(Scala edition)*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48677884-category-theory-for-programmers-scala-edition).

Note that this is a personal learning place that was created while
reading the book. I do encourage others to buy and read it!

Haskell code can be found in an [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell)
notebook `ctfp-hs.ipynb`. In order to view and edit it one can start a
Docker container running Jupyter with IHaskell kernel via
```bash
make haskell
```

Scala code can be found in a Scala - [Almond](https://almond.sh/)
notebook `ctfp-scala.ipynb`. In order to view and edit it one can start a
Docker container running Jupyter with Scala 2.13 kernel via
```bash
make scala
```
